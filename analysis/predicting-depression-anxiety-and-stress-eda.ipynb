    ">These are the results of an interactive version of the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale.<br>\n",
    "><br>\n",
    ">### Introduction:<br>\n",
    "> The Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale was first developed in 1953 to identify individuals who would be good subjects for studies of stress and other related psychological phenomenon. Since then it has been used as a measure of anxiety as general personality trait. Anxiety is a complex psychological construct that includes a multiple of different facets related to extensive worrying that may impair normal functioning. The test has been widely studied and used in research however there are some concerns that it does not measure a single trait but instead measures a basket of loosely related ones and so the score is not that meaningful.<br>\n",
    "><br>\n",
    ">### Procedure:<br>\n",
    ">The test consists of fifty statements about you. You must rate each one as true or false. It should take most people four to ten minutes to complete.<br>\n",
    "><br>\n",
    ">### Method <br>\n",
    ">This data was collected with an on-line version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS), see http://www2.psy.unsw.edu.au/dass/<br>\n",
    "><br>\n",
    ">The survey was open to anyone and people were motivated to take it to get personalized results. At the end of the test they also were given the option to complete a short research survey. This datatset comes from those who agreed to complete the research survey and answered yes to the question \"Have you given accurate answers and may they be used for research?\" at the end.<br>\n",
    "><br>\n",
    ">This data was collected 2017 - 2019.<br>\n",
    "><br>\n",
    ">The following items were included in the survey:<br>\n",
    "><br>\n",
    ">Q1    I found myself getting upset by quite trivial things.<br>\n",
    ">Q2    I was aware of dryness of my mouth.<br>\n",
    ">Q3    I couldn't seem to experience any positive feeling at all.<br>\n",
    ">Q4    I experienced breathing difficulty (eg, excessively rapid breathing, breathlessness in the absence of physical exertion).<br>\n",
    ">Q5    I just couldn't seem to get going.<br>\n",
    ">Q6    I tended to over-react to situations.<br>\n",
    ">Q7    I had a feeling of shakiness (eg, legs going to give way).<br>\n",
    ">Q8    I found it difficult to relax.<br>\n",
    ">Q9    I found myself in situations that made me so anxious I was most relieved when they ended.<br>\n",
